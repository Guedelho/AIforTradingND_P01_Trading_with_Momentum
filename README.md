# Momentum_Trading_Project

In this project we will implement a trading strategy on our own, and test it to see if it has the potential to be profitable. We will use a universe of stocks and a time range. We will be provided with a textual description of how to generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. 

After that we will compute the signal for the time range given and apply it to the dataset to produce projected returns.

Finally, we will perform a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. 

For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

This proyect is the first one in the Artificial Intelligence for Trading Nanodegree from Udacity.
